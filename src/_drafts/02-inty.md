  first: An interview app changing the job application experience for employers and employees through video.
  body:
    Inty allows employers to quickly and easily view a large range of candidates and create a short list with no cost, and because of requirements for applicants spam and underqualified applicants are filtered out of the process automatically.
    My task was to review the first beta release and optimise user flows and interactions and then redesign the interface to fit the initial target launch industry, high fashion retail.
