  body:
    The goal of this project was to optimise the interaction model for an existing iOS app and then design a new app for iOS, Android, Mac OS X, and Windows 10 using the guidelines specific to each platform.
    During this project I was exposed to working with a large team in Australia and Overseas to deliver different stages of the product. I gained experience through my interaction with the client, leading their focus on fundamental platform specific interactions.
