  caption: An app aimed at solving the problems people encounter when booking, paying,
    and claiming rebates for health care treatment.
  body: |-
    The goal of the project was to leverage the hicaps and medicare pay and claim systems to create a seamless customer experience. From finding a practitioner and booking an appointment, checking in and paying for an apointment, and claiming private health insurance and medicare rebates.
        Through rounds of user testing and interviews it was a clear objective to create a simple and intuative interface. As lead designer on this project I took this into account and made a focus on following the iOS design guidlines while adding in key elements that extended the experience to fit the project requirements.
