  first: A design concept for a Digital Studio that explores page interaction and modular design.
  body:
    I was given the task of designing a new portfolio site for my studio. I lead the visual and interaction design of the site. This was a nice opportunity for me to approach a project with no restrictions on art direction.
    I worked closely with our lead developer and contributed to the front end build of the hompage and key modules used throughout the site. This exposed me to learning to build an angular app front end for wordpress using the restful json api.
